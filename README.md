*Hello! I am Circa Kate Bartolata, 21, a 3rd-year student of Palawan State University taking up a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. You can call me Circa or Kit, just don't call me Kate because I'm not used to it. I love listening to music(esp. piano pieces). Also, I usually play video games, I like RPG and FPS types of games.*

**I'm not good at programming :), but I'll try to survive my study <3.**
